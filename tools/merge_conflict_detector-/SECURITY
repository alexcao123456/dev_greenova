SECURITY - Security Policy and Procedures for merge_conflict_detector
===============================================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This document outlines the security considerations, policies, and
procedures for the merge_conflict_detector project.

SECURITY PHILOSOPHY
-------------------
The merge_conflict_detector tool handles sensitive Git repository data
and must maintain the highest security standards while remaining
POSIX-compliant and portable.

THREAT MODEL
------------
Identified Threats:
  * Command Injection
      - Malicious branch names or repository paths could execute arbitrary commands
  * Path Traversal
      - Crafted file paths could access files outside the repository
  * Information Disclosure
      - Sensitive repository data could be exposed through error messages
  * Privilege Escalation
      - Tool could be tricked into accessing restricted areas
  * Resource Exhaustion
      - Large repositories could cause denial of service

SECURITY CONTROLS
-----------------
Input Validation:
  * Branch names are validated against Git naming conventions
  * Repository paths are canonicalized and bounded
  * File paths are checked for traversal attempts
  * Command arguments are properly escaped

Safe Command Execution:
  * All Git commands use absolute paths
  * Command arguments are validated and escaped
  * Process execution uses secure patterns
  * Environment variables are controlled

Example Secure Implementation (C):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/* Secure branch name validation */
static int
is_valid_branch_name(const char *branch_name)
{
    const char *p;

    if (branch_name == NULL || *branch_name == '\0') {
        return 0;
    }

    /* Check for dangerous characters */
    for (p = branch_name; *p != '\0'; p++) {
        if (*p == ';' || *p == '|' || *p == '&' ||
            *p == '$' || *p == '`' || *p == '\n') {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    /* Check for path traversal */
    if (strstr(branch_name, "..") != NULL) {
        return 0;
    }

    return 1;
}

/* Secure command execution */
static int
execute_git_command(const char *repo_path, const char *command,
                   const char *arg1, const char *arg2)
{
    char safe_command[MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH];
    int result;

    /* Validate all inputs */
    if (!is_valid_repo_path(repo_path) ||
        !is_valid_git_command(command) ||
        !is_valid_branch_name(arg1) ||
        !is_valid_branch_name(arg2)) {
        return ERROR_INVALID_INPUT;
    }

    /* Build command safely */
    result = snprintf(safe_command, sizeof(safe_command),
        "cd '%s' && git %s '%s' '%s'",
        repo_path, command, arg1, arg2);

    if (result >= sizeof(safe_command)) {
        return ERROR_COMMAND_TOO_LONG;
    }

    return system(safe_command);
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

File System Security:
  * Temporary files created with secure permissions (600)
  * Working directory restricted to repository bounds
  * Symlinks are resolved and validated
  * Race conditions prevented with atomic operations

Memory Safety:
  * Buffer boundaries strictly enforced
  * Dynamic memory properly allocated and freed
  * String operations use safe POSIX functions
  * Input size limits enforced

SECURE CONFIGURATION
--------------------
Default Security Settings:
  * Minimum privilege operation
  * Strict input validation enabled
  * Detailed logging disabled by default
  * Temporary file cleanup automatic

Environment Security:
  * PATH is not modified or trusted
  * Git commands use absolute paths
  * Shell metacharacters are escaped
  * Process environment is cleaned

Configuration File Security:
  * Files must have restrictive permissions (644 or 600)
  * Configuration parsing validates all values
  * No executable code in configuration
  * Default to secure options

VULNERABILITY REPORTING
-----------------------
Reporting Process:
  1. Do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
  2. Email security reports to: security@2MuchC0ff33.dev
  3. Include detailed reproduction steps
  4. Provide proof-of-concept if available
  5. Allow reasonable time for response (typically 48 hours)
